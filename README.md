# Power-Rangers-Post-Covid
# INTRODUCTION

Our Post Covid project is a technology, which helps people to sanitize all their objects including electronic gadgets and groceries after coming home without interacting with other people. Liquid sanitizers have a bad impact on electronic gadgets and groceries like damaging the display screen and rotting the vegetables.

Our solution is to sanitize objects without causing any external or internal damage to them. Our technology is safe, eco-friendly and is a benefit in terms of contactless and effortless sanitization.

# Solution

In our project we will be using:
1. Solar & Electrical Technology
2. UV Technology to remove virus that is present on objects
