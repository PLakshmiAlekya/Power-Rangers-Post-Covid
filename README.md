# Power-Rangers-Post-Covid
# INTRODUCTION

Our Post Covid project is a technology, which helps people to sanitize all their objects including electronic gadgets and groceries after coming home without interacting with other people. Liquid sanitizers have a bad impact on electronic gadgets and groceries like damaging the display screen and rotting the vegetables.
Our solution is to sanitize objects without causing any external or internal damage to them. Our technology is safe, eco-friendly and is a benefit in terms of contactless and effortless sanitization.

# Solution

In our project we will be using:
1. Solar & Electrical Technology
2. UV Technology to remove virus that is present on objects
Our aim is to use the knowledge on these technologies to make the prototype for our product which can be a replacement to the liquid sanitizers.
Our technology reduces the cost of purchasing liquid sanitizers and can be used to sanitize all the things that can fit into it and is a one-time investment for people.
This technology is handy and can be made in different sizes according to the customers’ requirement.

# COMPONENTS USED

Our solutions core components will be:
1. Ultraviolet (UV) LEDs
2. 1 Solar cell
3. 4 AA Re-chargeable batteries
4. 1 Resistor
5. 1 Breadboard 
6. 1 PCB(10cm x 10cm)
7. 1 Diode
8. 2 AA Battery holders
9. 1 DC Switch
10. DC wires
11. Aluminium Foil

# WORKING

Firstly, in our project we assembled UV LED’s and resistor on bread board and connected solar cell in parallel with the batteries as a power supply, wherein the batteries will be acting as a power backup.
We shifted the overall circuit to the PCB and then we placed the equipment in a box wrapped with Aluminium foil for better intensity.
We used solar cell to recharge the batteries. 
Hence, during the day we can get the power directly from the solar cell and in the evenings, we can get the power from both the charged batteries and the charged solar cell.
In this way we are using UV Technology to kill bacteria and virus, including Corona Virus, that is present on hands and objects.
